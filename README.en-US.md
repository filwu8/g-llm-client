G-LLM Client is a cross-platform desktop AI client built by GPROPHET LIMITED for Windows, macOS, and Linux. The product direction is assistant-first: users choose or create a role-based assistant, then use one desktop client for model configuration, knowledge references, screenshots, file understanding, and multi-turn conversations.

## Interface Preview

The workspace agent can read and modify files inside a user-authorized directory while showing its actions in the conversation. Eligible paid G-LLM users can also enable the exclusive gold theme.

Local file tools can generate, modify, and compress files in a conversation. Light and dark themes are available to every user.

## V1.2.2 Workspace Agent Reliability and Approval Experience

- Streaming workspace requests: model content and tool calls arrive continuously, while the 120-second limit now applies only when no new data arrives, preventing complex file tasks from being mistaken for timeouts at the final step.
- Full workspace support in Quick Chat: choose and display a folder, invoke workspace tools, review progress and results, and keep conversation state synchronized with the main window.
- Three approval modes: switch between Ask, Auto Approve, and Full Access at any time above the chat. In-app approval dialogs follow the current theme and explain the operation purpose and permission boundary.
- More capable script sandbox: safe Base64, Blob, and compression-stream APIs support more document and spreadsheet tasks while network access, system commands, and access outside the workspace remain blocked.
- Clearer failures: missing runtime capabilities and workbook structure mismatches are translated into user-friendly explanations that distinguish environment limits, changed files, and script errors.

## Features

- Cross-platform desktop client built with Electron, React, and TypeScript, with Windows, macOS, and Linux packaging.
- Assistant workflow with built-in assistants for general chat, documents, contracts, code, business analysis, and learning, plus creation, editing, drag reordering, pinning, hiding, restoring, and deletion.
- Chinese and English UI with system-language detection or manual selection across the main window, Quick Chat, and native menus.
- Multi-provider and multi-model setup with the default G-LLM gateway and OpenAI-compatible provider templates.
- Model management with connection tests, `/models` fetching, capability detection, and default model selection.
- Unified model selection across chat, global defaults, assistant settings, and quick chat, with capability labels and natural name sorting.
- Streaming chat, starter prompts, Markdown rendering, conversation history, and local persistence, with full dates, selected time zones, and total/input/output token details shared by the main window and Quick Chat.
- Intelligent conversation search across spaces using topics, people, tasks, or conclusions, with direct navigation back to the original conversation.
- Local-first features including lightweight knowledge base, assistant memory, persistent project memory, local data storage, and data import/export.
- Attachments and visual inputs including files, images, pasted clipboard content, system screenshots, and image copy to the system clipboard.
- Local file tasks that compress images or PDFs to a requested byte limit with approval, PDF rasterization warnings, non-destructive output, and per-file verification.
- Conversation workspaces that grant a single conversation controlled access to inspect, search, create, and modify files with a visible tool activity timeline.
- Web retrieval through Bing Search RSS and Google News RSS, with Chinese query planning and source deduplication before material is injected into the conversation context.
- Automatic system light/dark theming with manual overrides, plus a gold theme unlocked by a valid official G-LLM API key.
- Frosted-glass modal backdrops and progressive entry animations, with reduced-motion preference support.
- Privacy-friendly anonymous telemetry. The client only sends anonymous metadata and does not collect chat content, API keys, file content, screenshot content, knowledge base content, or memory content. Users can disable telemetry in settings.

## Desktop Resident Behavior

The client includes the following resident desktop behavior:

- A single click on the Windows tray icon, macOS menu-bar icon, or desktop pet opens Quick Chat; the context menu provides Open Main Window and the full set of actions.
- On Windows, closing the main window hides the app to the system tray instead of quitting.
- Minimizing the main window shows a floating G-LLM logo on the desktop.
- The floating logo can be dragged and snaps to the screen edge.
- The floating logo and tray/menu-bar icon share the same right-click menu: open Quick Chat, open the main window, show/hide the floating logo, and quit G-LLM.
- The quick chat window is transparent, frameless, always-on-top, and designed for fast access.
- Quick Chat and the main window share message actions, full timestamps, time zones, and token usage details.
- The screenshot button hides the current app window before entering the Windows screenshot flow.
- Single-instance protection is enabled. Launching the shortcut again brings the existing app to the front instead of starting another process.
- Main-process logs are written to `%APPDATA%/G-LLM/logs/main.log` for startup and crash diagnostics.

> Note: public Windows builds without a code-signing certificate may still be warned or blocked by Smart App Control or antivirus software. Trusted signing and Microsoft Store/MSIX distribution are handled as a separate release-compliance track.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Build:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm package:win
pnpm package:mac
pnpm package:linux
```

Build artifacts are written to `dist/`. GitHub Actions builds Windows, macOS, and Linux artifacts on their corresponding runners.

## API Contract

The client calls an OpenAI-compatible streaming Chat Completions endpoint:

```http
POST {apiBaseUrl}/chat/completions
Authorization: Bearer {apiKey}
Content-Type: application/json
```

Example request body:

```json
{
  "model": "g-llm-chat",
  "messages": [],
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "max_tokens": 4096,
  "stream": true
}
```

The default provider is G-LLM:

```text
https://llm.gprophet.com/v1
```

Users provide their own API key on first use. Additional OpenAI-compatible providers can also be configured from templates.

Model fetching uses:

```http
GET {apiBaseUrl}/models
Authorization: Bearer {apiKey}
```

The client supports standard OpenAI `/models` responses and simple string-array model lists.
